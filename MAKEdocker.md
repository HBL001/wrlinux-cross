Step-by-Step Guide: Building a Cross-Compiler Container
Step 0: Generate (Fetch) the SDK Installer

    Set Up Your Yocto Environment
    Open a terminal on your development PC and source your Yocto build environment (adjust the script path as needed):

source /path/to/your/wr-env.sh

Generate the SDK Installer
Run the Bitbake command for your target image (e.g., core-image-minimal):

bitbake core-image-minimal -c populate_sdk

Note: Replace core-image-minimal with your specific image name if required.

Locate and Prepare the SDK Installer
After the build completes, the installer should be found at:

/home/user/beagle/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/sdk/wrlinux-10.24.33.5-glibc-x86_64-beaglebone_yocto-core-image-minimal-sdk.sh

Verify it exists and is executable:

    ls -l /home/user/beagle/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/sdk/wrlinux-10.24.33.5-glibc-x86_64-beaglebone_yocto-core-image-minimal-sdk.sh
    chmod +x /home/user/beagle/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/sdk/wrlinux-10.24.33.5-glibc-x86_64-beaglebone_yocto-core-image-minimal-sdk.sh

Step 1: Verify and Test the SDK Installer on Your Host

    Display Installer Options
    Run:

/home/user/beagle/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/sdk/wrlinux-10.24.33.5-glibc-x86_64-beaglebone_yocto-core-image-minimal-sdk.sh --help

Confirm it supports options like -y (auto-confirm) and -d <dir> (destination directory).

Unset Conflicting Environment Variables
Unset any variables that might interfere (e.g., LD_LIBRARY_PATH):

unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Run the Installer Locally
Install the SDK into a temporary directory:

/home/user/beagle/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/sdk/wrlinux-10.24.33.5-glibc-x86_64-beaglebone_yocto-core-image-minimal-sdk.sh -y -d ~/sdk_install

You should see output indicating that extraction and setup completed and a success message similar to:

SDK has been successfully set up and is ready to be used.
Each time you wish to use the SDK, source the environment setup script, e.g.:
$ . /home/user/sdk_install/environment-setup-cortexa8hf-neon-wrs-linux-gnueabi

Verify the Installation
Source the environment setup script:

. ~/sdk_install/environment-setup-cortexa8hf-neon-wrs-linux-gnueabi

Then run:

    arm-wrs-linux-gnueabi-g++ --version

    You should see the version information for the ARM cross-compiler.

Step 2: Prepare the Docker Build Context

    Create a Docker Build Directory
    On your development PC, create and change to a directory for your Docker build:

mkdir ~/wrlinux-docker
cd ~/wrlinux-docker

Copy the SDK Installer into the Build Context
Copy the installer from Step 0:

    cp /home/user/beagle/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/sdk/wrlinux-10.24.33.5-glibc-x86_64-beaglebone_yocto-core-image-minimal-sdk.sh .

    (Optional) Gather Additional Scripts
    If you have any extra configuration or build scripts (for instance, for file synchronization or logging), place them in this directory as needed.

Step 3: Create the Dockerfile

see the Dockerfile entry is this repos

Step 4: Build the Docker Image

    Build the Image:
    In the ~/wrlinux-docker directory, run:

    docker build -t cu1bo/wrlinux-cross:latest .

    Monitor the Build:
    Ensure the build completes without errors.

Step 5: Verify the Cross-Compiler Environment Inside the Container

    Run the Container with Your Host Directory Mounted (Optional):
    If your source code and build directories reside in /home/user on your host, you can mount that directory into the container:

docker run -it --rm -v /home/user:/home/user cu1bo/wrlinux-cross:latest bash

This ensures that your host’s /home/user is available inside the container for compilation.

Verify the SDK Environment:
Inside the container, run:

echo $PATH

You should see /opt/wrlinux-toolchain/bin included.
Then test the cross-compiler:

    arm-wrs-linux-gnueabi-g++ --version

    If you see the expected version output (for example, GCC 13.3.0), your cross-compilation toolchain is set up correctly.

Step 6: Pushing and Pulling the Docker Image
Pushing the Image

    Log In to Docker Hub:

docker login

Push the Image:

    docker push cu1bo/wrlinux-cross:latest

    This uploads your image to your Docker Hub repository.

Pulling the Image on Another System

On any system with Docker installed, run:

docker pull cu1bo/wrlinux-cross:latest

Then you can run the container as before:

docker run -it --rm -v /home/user:/home/user cu1bo/wrlinux-cross:latest bash

This ensures you have a ready-to-go cross-compilation environment that mirrors your development PC’s structure.
Final Summary

    Generate the SDK Installer:
    Set up your Yocto environment, run Bitbake to populate the SDK, and ensure the installer is executable.

    Verify the SDK on Your Host:
    Run the installer locally, source the environment setup script, and verify that the cross-compiler works.

    Prepare the Docker Build Context:
    Create a directory, copy the SDK installer, and add any additional scripts.

    Create the Dockerfile:
    Use the provided Dockerfile to install system dependencies, create the user, run the SDK installer, configure additional settings, and switch to the non-root “user”.

    Build the Docker Image:
    Build the image using docker build.

    Verify the Environment in the Container:
    Run the container (optionally mounting your host’s /home/user), source the environment, and verify the cross-compiler.

    Push and Pull the Docker Image:
    Push the image to Docker Hub and pull it on any system to have a ready-to-go cross-compilation container.

Follow these steps one at a time and test each section. This will give you a fully functional Docker-based cross-compilation environment for your Wind River Linux project. Let me know if you need further assistance!
